# Virtual-Mouse-With-Hand-Gesture🖱️
This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to create a virtual mouse that tracks your hand gestures to control your computer’s mouse. The project simulates mouse movements, clicks, and scrolling gestures, providing a touch-free interface inspired by modern gesture-based systems.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Python**: Programming language used to implement the logic.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and hand tracking visualization.
- **MediaPipe**: To detect hand landmarks in real-time.
- **PyAutoGUI**: To simulate mouse events.

## Gestures Guide 🖐️

| Gesture                      | Action         |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| Index finger pointing        | Move cursor    |
| Thumb + Index finger pinch   | Left click     |
| Wrap all fingers to wrist    | Scroll down    |




Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
